Wouldn't it be dreamy if you could get the full Rails development environment, as described in the book [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/), up in a snap, without the headache of loading a bunch of software and reconciling a bunch of dependencies and incompatibilities between packages?  And wouldn't it be nice if you could just pop in a USB drive, boot the full-blown setup and get to work, without impacting your regular computer environment?  

This project provides a ready-bake Ubuntu-based Ruby on Rails environment that you can simply "burn and boot".  You can run it from a CD, USB drive or virtual machine, without impacting your installed computer environment.  It should be usable on most Intel x86 compatible computers that can run Linux, OS X, or Windows. 


There is a sister project that describes how to manually install the environment onto your hard drive.  Even if you are using this ready-bake version, see the "Instructions" file provided for the sister project for details about the various components comprising the environment.  Also see that project's "Usage-Notes.txt" file for day to day usage tips, which apply to this project as well:
